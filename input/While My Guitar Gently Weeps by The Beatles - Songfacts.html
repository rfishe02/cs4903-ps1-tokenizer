An incredible song by three of the most influential artists in music history. Harrison's lyrics combined with Clapton's lead guitar  and McCartney's driving bass make this one of my favorites.

Incredible. Fact is that Paul's bass line provides much of the texture and power of this song, so that Clapton can spend his energy on playing melodically. The bass line is simply spectacular.<br><br>Having said that I actually prefer the solo acoustic demo version. Personally I find the lyrics better composed in that version.</li><li class="comment" style="display: list-item;"><span class="comment-credit">Megan from Stevenson, Al</span>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this song!

Gems like "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" are rare indeed.</li><li class="comment" style="display: list-item;"><span class="comment-credit">Kim from San Pedro, Belize</span>In reference to what inspired George Harrison to write this song, please see what follows:  Composition and recordingInspiration for the song came to Harrison when reading the I Ching, which, as he put it, "seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else...opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental." Taking this idea of relativism to his parents home in northern England, Harrison committed to write a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a random book. Those words were "gently weeps", and he immediately began the song. As he said:<br>"I wrote "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" at my mother's house in Warrington. I was thinking about the Chinese I Ching, the Book of Changes... The Eastern concept is that whatever happens is all meant to be, and that there's no such thing as coincidence - every little item that's going down has a purpose. <br>"While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was a simple study based on that theory. I decided to write a song based on the first thing I saw upon opening any book - as it would be a relative to that moment, at that time. I picked up a book at random, opened it, saw 'gently weeps', then laid the book down again and started the song.<br>The initial incarnation was not final, as Harrison said: "Some of the words to the song were changed before I finally recorded it." A demo recorded at George's home in Esher includes an unused verse:<br>I look at the trouble and see that it's raging,<br>While my guitar gently weeps.<br>As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but aging,<br>Still, my guitar gently weeps.<br>As well as an unused line in the very beginning:<br>The problems you sow, are the troubles you're reaping,<br>Still, my guitar gently weeps.<br>This line was eventually omitted in favour of the one appearing on The Beatles. An early acoustic guitar/organ take of the song, released on Anthology 3 and also used as the basis of the Love remix, featured a slightly different third verse:<br>I look from the wings at the play you are staging,<br>While my guitar gently weeps.<br>As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but aging,<br>Still, my guitar gently weeps.<br>The band recorded the song several times, including a version with a backward guitar solo (as Harrison had done for "I'm Only Sleeping" on Revolver, but Harrison was not satisfied. On 6 September 1968, during a ride from Surrey into London, Harrison asked Eric Clapton to add a lead guitar solo to the song. Clapton was reluctant-he said, "Nobody ever plays on the Beatles' records"-but Harrison convinced him and Clapton's solo was recorded that evening. Harrison later said that in addition to his solo, Clapton's presence had another effect on the band: "It made them all try a bit harder; they were all on their best behaviour."<br>I believe this to be true.  It also stated whom was involved in the recording that ended up being released on the White Album, which follows:<br> PersonnelGeorge Harrison - double-tracked vocal, backing vocal, acoustic guitar, Hammond organ<br>Paul McCartney - backing vocal, piano, organ, bass<br>John Lennon - electric guitar<br>Ringo Starr - drums, tambourine<br>Eric Clapton - lead guitar<br>Personnel per Ian MacDonald<br></li><li class="comment" style="display: list-item;"><span class="comment-credit">Matt from Washington, Dc, Dc</span>In the days when The Beatles could not be found, I relied upon the Phish version of this song.  Today when I hear the original, it is like listening to original recordings of King Oliver from the early part of the 20th century.

It seems to me completely NOT characteristic of his playing then or since, in the tone of the guitar and its overall pace and phrasing. It has the melodic feel, in fact, of a Harrison solo. Though I don't doubt it was played by Clapton, Harrison may well have suggested the sort of thing he wanted Clapton to play. It seems a great melding of the two musicians. It's worth remembering that Clapton was barely into his 20s at the time. If you love the solo in the original, you must absolutely check out the Concert for George version. Generously long, and achingly beautiful! As for classic Clapton, if you want to connect with the distilled essence of his revolutionary brilliance at the time, it is all there in his solo in Sunshine of Your Love -- the fitful, off-kilter phrasing, the savage attack, and the most grungy bends you'll ever hear. And of course his signature "woman tone." He became a different player when he switched to the Fender.</li><li class="comment" style="display: list-item;"><span class="comment-credit">Steff from Montclair, Nj</span>"For every mistake, we must surely be learning."

You may have read or heard about Paul, George, and Ringo jamming together at Eric Clapton's wedding to Patti Boyd in 1979.   The only one missing was John.   About a month later Eric ran into John and asked him why he hadn't attended the wedding.   John's reply was "I didn't get an invitation, I would have loved to have been there!"   Eric cursed himself for not being more thorough about getting his invitations out and being the possible roadblock of a full fledged Beatles reunion.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Budoshi from Sandnessjøen, Norway</span>You should all listen to Jeff Healeys cover of this song.. it is absolutely FANTASTIC. Infact, I dare to say better than the Beatles original in many ways..</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Breanna from Henderson, Nv</span>This is my favorite Beatles song ever! It's so cool. I just love the rythem of it! The lyrics are so deep, for example, "I look at the world and I notice it's turning" that's so deep and cool! George's my favorite Beatle and he wrote some awesome songs!</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Dave from Scottsdale, Az</span>If you listen to the song and think in terms of the Beatle's history at the time, you can see George was talking about the way he was treated by the other Beatles (John and Paul). His guitar is weeping because of the fact that it (his songs) is not being used. He had just threatened to quit. The session from the White Album include several Harrison songs that they worked on and never made it to the album; several made it to George's solo albums. Try listening to the song in that context.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Billy from West Unity, Oh</span>To anyone who thinks that sampleing this song and using it for rap or hip hop or what ever strikes their fancy should be taken out back and SHOT.

Too many ---who don't play guitar and never studied music---underrate Harrison and overrate Clapton.<br><br>And I must say, your inclusion of true guitar virtuosos(harmonic sophistication, technical achievements)  Wes Montgomery, Segovia, Les Paul was simply inspired. <br><br>Paul was an insufferable egoist, and I can only imagine what Harrison felt when, after jamming w/Clapton, Robertson, Mason, et al, all of whom respected Harrison's abilities, he had to listen to McCartney condescend and bully as to how he, Harrison, should play any given solo. I do respect Paul's contributions---in the Beatles---but his horrible output, which did so much to undermine his own towering artistic legacy thereafter proved just vital Harrison's contributions really were.<br><br>Many thanks for your very musically informed, well-reasoned, and respectful post. I hope many fans read it, and I especially hope up-and-coming musicians do, as well </li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Rahul from Chennai, India</span>so serene, haunting n beautiful....a true masterpiece..... clapton excels in his work...to those who criticize the beatles i jus wanna say this...*sticks up middle finger*....eat tat...</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Austin from Smallsville, New England</span>Wu Tang Clan samples this song on their song "The Heart Gently Weeps".

The song deals with a bad drug deal.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Chloe from St. Louis, Mo</span>and i forgot to mention- the acoustic version on 'love' is gorgeous as well. its very sad and mellow, and portrays the feeling of the words well. i recommend you listen to it if you already havent.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Chloe from St. Louis, Mo</span>eminem actually covered this?! ack! guitars everywhere are weeping. this is such a beautiful song- the epic guitar work by clapton, the bassline, george's lyrics. its all perfect. we'll never know EXACTLY what any beatles song means, but the lyrics make me think of how george must have reacted to the tensions in the band, and how he saw the world in general. during the first verse, i always picture the four of them in the studio bickering, with george staring at the floor, thinking of the "love that lies sleeping" between them. just my interpretation.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Linc from Beaumont, Tx</span>This song is like a tributary to the end of the Beatles or the beginning of the end.

I tihnk he's the best Beatles composer. But one thing I didn't like, or undestand in "While my...weeps", is when he says " I don't know why you were inverted, no one alerted you".Is it about sexuality? If it is, it didn't sound good in plain sixties. Somebody can help me, if I'm right?</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Ken from Louisville, Ky</span>This was the only track on the Beatles' "Love" soundrtrack that had new music.  When George Martin first heard George's demo in 1968, he wanted to score a string backing with George playing accoustic guitar, but George vetoed that, saying it had been done before with "Yesterday". George Martin said that he always wanted to do a version like that and got Paul, Ringo, Yoko and Olivia's permission to break the rules of the project - no original music - this one time, with strings backing George singing and playing accoustic guitar from 1968.   </li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Matt from Philadelphia, Pa</span>Everyone should check out  Prince's guitar solo from the performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductions a few years back.

As is the entire song.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Michael from Pittsburgh, Pa</span>An earlier comment is exactly correct - despite the brilliance of the guitar work on this song, and the beauty of the vocals, by far the most interesting part of this song musically is McCartney's bass line.  Until I heard this line I subscribed to the common theory that McCartney wasn't much of a bassist.  That theory is false. </li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Ken from San Diego, Ca</span>All time great song from Harrison and the Beatles. Clapton's guitar was a perfect choice but what is really outstanding is Paul's bass. Listen to it closly and Paul keeps up with Clapton every step of the way.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Shane from Toronto, Canada</span>This song is about Harrison playing the guitar whilst looking at the world for inspiration, but finding nothing because we've lost our ability to be truly passionate- loving- to one another. He can't understand why it's become so hard for us to love; why we've never been taught; but is "hopeful" that we may be moving in the right direction by learning from our mistakes. He's describing what he's seeing; yet the fact that his own floor needs to be cleaned is an analogy that he too is neglecting his responsibilities to making the world a better place.  He's also talking about how we've been tricked into being this way. Maybe suggesting it's something systematic. </li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Kevin from Albany, Or</span>Why does George says "Paul, Paul, Paul" at the end? It's because Paul is dead of course and Harrison's guitar is crying for him. <br><br>And yes, before everyone jumps down my throat, he didn't say "Paul, Paul, Paul."</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Peter Griffin from Quahog, Ri</span>This is one of George's best songs (3 best).

And one of the things that inspired John to write A Day In The Life,(Paul of course wrote the middle section Woke up fell out of bed etc, but he also wrote most of the music including the notes rising and then crashing down on the piano,and Paul half conducted the British Philharmonic Orchestra with George Martin at only age 24!)was that he was reading The Daily Mail about the cororners report on the 21 year old guiness heir Tara Browne who died in a car crash in December 1966 and who was a good friend of theirs,Paul met him first in a club and introduced him to John,and Mick Jagger,Keith Richards and Brian Jones were good friends with him too,because they met him through Paul and John.He was a very good friend of Paul's. </li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Amanda from Concord, Ca</span>I HAD HEARD THAT THE SONG WAS WRITEN FOR HIS THEN WIFE AT THE TIME BECAUSE SHE WAS CHEATING ON HIM WITH CLAPTON.

George is in reference to the fact that we as a race are being misled, controlled, and away from our natural state of being.  He states he doesn't know how it happened, but he sees it.  He's talking about the effects of our negative ego and external influences that keep us from getting in touch with the most powerful force in the universe Love.  And the "mistakes" are simply the path which we must all travel in order to grow and expand our level of awareness. Quite simply he is expressing his empathetic observation of the level conciousness most humans are in.  Very insightful George and inspirational.  If people would just stop to really listen.  So much more is going on than most realize.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Ozzy from Fresno, Ca</span>I love the early stuff, it's just whenever i think of their beginning i think of happy. A day in the life was realeased in their later years to me, and the first album I ever listened to them was please please me, though my favorite is perhaps sgt pepper. Im only stereotyping, and if you dont like the happy stuff, thats okay<br>--this contains one of the greatest guitar solos of all time. Rolling Stone can suck it because george harrison is underrated because of them</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Peter Griffin from Quahog, Ri</span>Jill, A Day In The Life is not a early Beatles song.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Jeff from Northeast, Pa</span>I Think it is about George learning how to play guitar, "With every mistake we must be learning, still my guitar gentlt weeps". He sings about work to be done "floor needs sweeping" etc, but he has to practice because his guitar is weeping and learning how to play is the most important thing at the moment. To me it is a genius of a song singing about his bad playing, and playing so well to make it sound like he doesn't know how.<br>Just my opinion. Peace, Jeff NE PA</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Domenico from Wenham, Ma</span>The Beatles were basically teenagers when they wrote their earlier stuff.  As they got older their songs had more meaning because they had experienced more.  The song "Misery" is about someone's girlfriend and the very teenage "everything bad always happens to me".  Harrison's song, as well as many later Beatles songs, were a bit more complex than that.  The earlier songs also, even though the lyrics might be a little down, were nice and upbeat... theirs more to the mood of a song than the lyrics.<br><br>One of the best Beatles songs by far.  We would have seen a lot more Harrison wonders if the band had kept going.  His solo stuff, to me, seems a little drowned out.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Jill from Dumfries, Va</span>ozzy, you're dead wrong, if you listen to the beatles early work (i.e. please please me, beatles for sale ect.) you will find that not all beatles songs are happy (i.e. misery, a day in the life, baby's in black, i'm a loser ect.)</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Jill from Dumfries, Va</span>i have to admit, the guitar solo at the end of the original version of this song on the white album where john lennon is basically moaning over it brings tears to my eyes everytime.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Ozzy from Fresno, Ca</span>this song is so deep and the guitar solo is very emotional. not only is it one of my fav beatles songs but its one of my fav songs ever. it also proves that all the beatles did was happy love and bluesy songs [and there are other songs like this too by them] and i hate it when people put stuff like pink floyd in front of them.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Mitz from Sumter, Sc</span>"With every mistake we must surly be learning."<br>The song is about the state the world is in. How anyone can think it may be about masturbation is well beyond me. The three top songs George Harrison wrote in my opinion are Something, Here comes the sun, and Weeps.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Wyatt from Anywhere, United States</span>I have to say I like Georges songs best of any of the beatles, they probably arn't as mainstream but definatelythe most thoughtful.  Saying Eric Clapton was a better guitarist is a pretty shakey premise.  George played to the song in his recordings and often had to tone back due to Paul's insistance, from what I know Paul was a bit of a control freak which antagonized the others, of course John dd that a lot as well and was more well known for it.  George was a heck of a lot more versitile than Eric on guitar than Eric by a long shot but he was more flashy.  Peter Green was a MUCH better Blues guitarist inmy opinion and even BB KIng stated that Peter was " the only white boy that ever made me cry"  Unfortunatly his mental illness and his reluctance both to the limelight and to comercialize his music made him decide he needed to take a break and put less pressure on himself, <br>Santana seems to have gotten much of his blues side from Peter and coverd Peter's "Black Magic Woman".  George brought Eric into the studio because he knew this song was a good one and wasn't getting any cooperation from John and Paul whose ego's were pretty dominate in the group.  Eric is a good Guitarist but far from the best by any standard except popularity and he's a bit of an imitator though he had good taste in doing it. HIs covers of JJ Cales songs, such as After Midnight and Cocaine aren't as good as the originals but more mainstream so they are more popular. His originals are pretty vanilla for the most part but I still like him.  I don't know how anybody can say somebody is the best however because the best ones have different styles and its like comparing apples to oranges.  Hendrix, Robert Fripp, John Mc Laughlin, Peter Green, Wes Montgomery, Segovia, Johnny Winter, Les Paul, etc etc etc there there are so many and they are all different, thats part of what makes them great.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Jose from Guanacaste, South America</span>great song</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Krista from Elyria, Oh</span>I love George's songs!

It was a rumor began in the late 60's, by some radio station DJ, that Paul McCartney had died in a car crash. Soon after the time that some thought was the date of the death of paul mccartney there was a paul mccartney look-a-like contest, where the winner was never announced. Some people say this winner was paid money to "be paul". There were some "hidden clues" in the beatles songs, one of them being this "Paul...Paul..." moaning on this song. Ofcourse (or not ofcrouse to some people, but to me...this is just my (and the majority's) opinion, but paul was not really dead. some people think it was a joke by the beatles, i think its just some outrageous people finding the smallest things and trying to make them into clues. i bet you if you get these outrageous people, they couldve made a "john is dead" rumor, with as many clues.<br>try googling "Paul is Dead" if you want to know more. the stuff i wrote might not be a 100% accurate, and a lot of it is my opinion.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Gerard from Honikiwi, New Zealand</span>This is one of the Harrisongs with the irritating high whine in the background, probably from being Beatled-up on the ADT.

I don't know what took me so long to purchase it, but I am happy that I finally broke down and got it. It was even better than I would have imagined. It was definately worth the thirty dollars, ($30.00), to say the least. Eric Clapton, Paul Mccartney, and alot of other entertainers contributed to a fantastic celebration of George Harrison's life. I have never seen so much talent all together on one stage. The people who performed Harrison's songs, did them justice. I think my favorite was "Here comes the sun."  Paul Mccartney played his ukelele (can't spell that word) to "Something" It was great to see Paul and Ringo together again, and George's son looks so much like his father. It is uncanny! You could swear that was George standing there. It almost looked like three of the Beatles had reunited. He is right there with the others, playing his guitar, and joining in on all the songs. There was a great deal of Eastern musical influence, at the beginning of the dvd, and then all of George's songs after that. I recommend that you do not fast forward through this music. I am not a big fan of the sitar, or the sound of that music, but even I was impressed with that sound at the beginning. It was foreign music, but maybe that is what made it so intriguing. The lady playing the sitar, in the beginning is extremely talented. (She was the "Eric Clapton" of the sitar, so to speak.) Of course, being a Beatle fan, I enjoyed George's songs alot more. The people who performed his songs most certainly did them justice. (or did i say that already?)The number of Harrison fans in attendance did not surprise me in the slightest. I would have expected that many, but none the less their presence, and enthusiasm contributed to the celebration of Harrison's life. My two favorite performers were Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton. No one has ever seen either of those guys do a so so performance! They always steal the show. The dvd is well worth the cost of admittion. (and that is an understatement) If you were a fan of George Harrison's, and if you like Paul Mccartney and Eric Clapton, you are in for one heck of a show. It is an experience you will not soon forget. It runs about two hours and twenty minutes, and the time goes by far too fast as far as I am concerned. If you are planning on staying home for New Years Eve,(like i am ), this dvd would be the perfect way to spend an enjoyable evening at home. (Be smart this year, spend the holiday with your family,and let the drunk drivers risk their own lives, and not yours!)I guarantee you that you will watch this dvd again and again. It is the kind of performance that will make you want to. With a good sound machine it will knock your socks off. I am very sincere, and not prone to endorse things, but this time I just had to make an exception. enjoy! I know you will. If anyone does purchase this, please let me know if you enjoyed it as much as I did. I am sure you will have.  I will be watching it again on New Years Eve too. I guarantee neither you or I will  be disapointed ( or hung over )in any way. Peace,<br></li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Guitar from Nashville, Tn</span>I almost like this song on the Anthology 3 CD better.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Patrick from Hull, England</span>Clapton is the only one who could have played the solo on the original, but just listen to his solo on the Concert For George. <br><br>It is stunning and full of Claptons grief for his dear friend.

I heard this from the owner of Whirlwind Audio.  He made a guitar effect box and gave it to Taj Mahal at a Rochester concert at the Red Creek.  Taj liked it so much that he took it to England where the Beatles and Rolling Stones loved it.  His company, MXR?, went from zero to million dollar company because of the big artists.  Taj Mahal,it was reveal much later, played guitar solo.  Big artists of the time never revealed stand-in musicians because they had to keep up a reputation.  Makes sense to me.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">John Doe from Anytown, Al</span>There was also an acoustic demo recorded in the Esher Sessions, which is also quite nice, but slightly off-key. You can hear it on Anthology 3.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">David from Waco, Tx</span>As for the climate being better when Clapton was in the studio, I read where John Lennon said that like a family they were better behaved when they had "company".George Harrison was so great.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">JoÃ£o from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil</span>Why he says "Paul, Paul, Paul"?... Such imagination! He doesn't say it, what he says in the end is just "Oh... Oh... Oh..." and then "Yeah.... Yeah... Yeah..."!</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Liliana from Huntley, Il</span>really? well, I bet they didn't even come close to the way george played it. i think it's his best song, i luv it. any other teens here?</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">James from Wellington, New Zealand</span>This was covered by the metal band Spineshank.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Scott Baldwin from Edmonton, Canada</span>Why does george say "paul,paul,paul,paul..." at the fadeout?does anyone know?</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Chas from Webster, Ny</span>Um, the grey album was made by DJ dangermouse. He stole samples from this song and overlayed it onto the jay-z song. It was a great song, in my opinion. a shame that the music industry is only bout money, and not the sound...</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Kyle from Madison, Al</span>Prince claims in a recent issue of Rolling Stone that he hadn't even heard this song until it was sent to him shortly before the Hall of Fame induction.  I find that very hard to believe.  Everyone's heard this song.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Nick from San Francisco, Ca</span>of course, this has now been turned into the first "single" (ok, it's the one I heard on the radio) from the Grey Album. I guess Jay-Z is an improvement over Eminem... but it's still just screwing around with perfection.<br><br>Oh, and I'd have figured bringing Clapton in would have made the climate within the band much worse, not better...</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Ian from San Marino, Ca</span>hahahaha eminem used this song for his own  music?  hahaha, that would really make a guitar weep!  what a great song... ironically, before i liked to listen to this song because it has been a special meaning to me, of how all guitars should weep with the crap floating around today in the radiowaves</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Tim from Charlotte, Nc</span>Prince played an incredible version of the guitar solo at the 2004 induction of George Harrison into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Prince showed not only his virtuosity on the guitar, but also a deep respect for Farrison and Clapton - imo.<br>Tim, Charlotte NC</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Carroll from Toms River, Nj</span>To have any part of this song a part of anything that Eminem does should be considered a classic rock sin!!</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Robb from Hamburg, Ny</span>This is in my opinion the best song on the enritre White Album LP. I really believe that George could have played this solo easily, as it is not to difficult.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Geoff from Adelaide, Australia</span>Magical song...I really love the intro</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Kay from Wakefield, Ma</span>A beautiful song, probably George's best.</li><li class="comment"><span class="comment-credit">Marvin from East Brady, Pa</span>A variation of this song's melody was used by Eminem in Hailie's Song.</li></ul><a id="load-more-comments" class="button white bgr-orange auth fullwidth text-center mar-top-20" href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/the-beatles/while-my-guitar-gently-weeps#see-more-comments">see more comments</a>
